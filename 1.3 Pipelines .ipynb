    "### Stringing it All Together\n",
    "_____________________\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipelines** has a few different meanings in Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates some ambiguity as the terms are often used interchangably.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's [Spark Pipelines](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/ml-pipeline.html), used to process data in PySpark. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then there's the overarching idea of the Data Science Pipeline: a concept in business that describes the general process for going from raw data to something that creates value for the business, as this [example](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ba-intro-data-science-1/index.html) from IBM illustrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, there is the scikit-learn Pipeline tool. This can be described as a simple way, using scikit-learn, to work through the beginning/middle steps of the Data Science Pipeline. **In scikit-learn, a Pipeline is a string of transforms with a final estimator.** All of these steps in the pipeline (transformers and estimators) can be user-defined or from scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can make user-defined pipeline steps by inheriting from the TransformerMixin and BaseEstimator parent classes**. If you inherit from these and write your transformer or estimator properly, they will work together in the pipeline seamlessly!\n",

    "    AdderTransformer(add=10),\n",
    "    MeanNormalizer()\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calling `fit` on the pipeline is the same as calling fit on each estimator in turn, transform the input and pass it on to the next step. The pipeline has all the methods that the last estimator in the pipeline has, i.e. if the last estimator is a classifier, the Pipeline can be used as a classifier. If the last estimator is a transformer, again, so is the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `sklearn.pipeline.make_union`\n",
